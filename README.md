# LOAN_APPROVAL_PREDICTION
Wise Project

The idea behind this ML project is to build an ML model and web application that the bank can use to classify if a user can be granted a loan or not.

Data Set Description:

The dataset contains information about Loan Applicants.

ðŸ‘‰ There are 13 variables in this data set:

5 categorical variabls

8 continuous variables

This dataset attributes:

loan_id

no_of_dependents

education

self_employed

income_annum

loan_amount

loan_term

cibil_score

Credit_History

marital_status

Gender

bank_asset_value

loan_status

To load the training data in your colab, use the below command:

loan_dataset = pd.read_csv('Load Data.csv')

Data Description

Loan_ID: A unique ID assigned to every loan applicant

Gender: Gender of the applicant (Male, Female)

Married: The marital status of the applicant (Yes, No)

Dependents: No. of people dependent on the applicant (0, 1, 2, 3+)

Education: Education level of the applicant (Graduated, Not Graduated)

Self_Employed: If the applicant is self-employed or not (Yes, No)

Annum_Income: The amount of income the applicant earns

LoanAmount: The amount of loan the applicant has requested for

Credit_History: A record of a borrower's responsible repayment of debts (1 - has all debts paid, 0 - not paid)

Loan_Status: Is the Loan Approved or Not


Test Dataset:

Load the test data "Loan_Prediction_dataset.csv". You can load the data using the below command.

loan_dataset = pd.read_csv('train_u6lujuX_CVtuZ9i (1).csv')
